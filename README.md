# Baby LM for English and Rioplatense Spanish

This repository contains code to train a language model with limited data. Following the BabyLM Challenge (Warstadt et al., 2023), a model is trained with English data and another one with Rioplatense Spanish data, both in the news domain. 

**How to run this repository:**

Download this repository and place it in your Google Drive under a folder called `Colab Notebooks`.

## English BabyLM

### Training

`BabyTraining_EN.ipynb`

Run this notebook on Colab to train an LM with 7M tokens of English data.

The dataset used is version 1.0.0. of the CNN/DailyMail Dataset (See et al., 2017).

The dataset is already cleaned in earlier steps before training. Therefore, it is not necessary to run the `data_to_csv()` function in the first cell.

The notebook can be run from the following cell onwards to train the LM:
`df = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/baby-lm/data/EN_sentences.csv")` 

### Evaluation

#### Fill Mask

`BabyEvaluation_EN.ipynb`

After training the model, check whether the model trained with the Fill Mask Pipeline (HuggingFace).

#### BLiMP and EWoK

The evaluation on BLiMP and EWoK is done following the Evaluation Pipeline of the 2024 BabyLM challenge: (https://github.com/babylm/evaluation-pipeline-2024?tab=readme-ov-file)

Download the evaluation repository and update both scripts (`eval_blimp.sh` and `eval_ewok.sh`) with: \
 change `--model hf` to `--model hf-mlm` \
 change `backend="causal"` to `backend="mlm"`

Run each evaluation the terminal from the root directory of the evaluation repository (`evaluation-pipeline-2024`):

`./eval_blimp.sh <path_to_model>`

`./eval_ewok.sh <path_to_model>`

`<path_to_model>` should be the absolute path to the English BabyLM model folder.

The results are stored under the `results` directory in the `evaluation-pipeline-2024` root directory.


## Spanish BabyLM

### Training

`BabyTraining_ES.ipynb`

Run this notebook on Colab to train an LM with 7M tokens of Rioplatense Spanish data.


The dataset used is the articles and comments dataset from PIUBA (PÃ©rez et al., 2023).

Same as with the English model above, the dataset is already cleaned in earlier steps before training. Therefore, it is not necessary to run the `data_to_csv()` function in the first cell.

The notebook can be run from the following cell onwards to train the LM:
`df = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/baby-lm/data/ES_sentences.csv")` 

### Evaluation

#### Fill Mask

`BabyEvaluation_ES.ipynb`

After training the model, check whether the model trained with the Fill Mask Pipeline (HuggingFace).

#### EWoK

After checking the perfomance of the English model on BLiMP and EWoK, and due to the challenges posed by language-specific focus of BLiMP, EWoK is chosen to evaluate the Rioplatense Spanish model.

**Data creation**

Given the performance of the English model, the following categories are created for Spanish:

- material-dynamics
- material-properties
- social-relations

The datasets are created following the EWoK paper (Ivanova et al., 2024) and tutorial (https://github.com/ewok-core/ewok/tree/main)

The files and templates are provided under the `data/es-ewok` directory in password-protected zips following the recommendation of the authors. The password is the same as the original EWoK password-protected datasets (i.e., ewok). 

Note: Due to the same reason, only the final files are provided and not the templates created with the tutorial.

**Evaluation**

Same as with the English model, the evaluation is done following the Evaluation Pipeline of the 2024 BabyLM challenge: (https://github.com/babylm/evaluation-pipeline-2024?tab=readme-ov-file)

Before running the evaluation, make the following changes in the repository:

- Replace the files under `ewok_filtered` folder with the generated Spanish jsonl files.

- Under `lm_eval/tasks/ewok_filtered` folder, open the file `generate_configs.py` and change `all_subtasks` to the subtasks relevant for Spanish only with the name given in ES: `"material-dinamico", "material-propiedades" "social-relaciones"`. 
Remove any .yaml file remaining from the English evaluation.


Run the evaluation on the terminal from the root directory of the evaluation repository (`evaluation-pipeline-2024`):

`./eval_ewok.sh <path_to_model>`

`<path_to_model>` should be the absolute path to the Rioplatense Spanish BabyLM model folder.

The results are stored under the `results` directory in the `evaluation-pipeline-2024` root directory.
